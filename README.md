Nodejs studies and using Express


During a few days I studied about NodeJS, learned HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE. I learned about parameter types like Query params, Route params, Request body. And I also learned about middleware.

To start the project, you need use 'yarn start', we are using nodemon for refresh the server application.

Use Insomnia or Postman to do the requests. 

To generate the id I used the uuidv4 library.
